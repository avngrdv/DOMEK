# DOMEK: mRNA display-based one-shot measurement of enzymatic kinetics

## About

This repository holds the code to implement a DOMEK pipeline for the computation and analysis of k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> values for substrates of PTM enzymes. The original pipeline was developed to analyze >200,000 substrates of a promiscuous dehydroamino acid reductase using mRNA display-derived NGS data. For further details, please refer to the accompanying paper: <i>tbd</i>. Please cite it if you use this code.

## Setup and Usage

Pipeline setup and usage is shown here: [DOMEK pipeline walkthrough](https://nbviewer.org/github/avngrdv/DOMEK/blob/main/src/DOMEK_pipeline_walkthrough.ipynb)
An interactive `.ipynb` notebook is provided in `.src/DOMEK_pipeline_walkthrough.ipynb`.
